# You can specify the shared libraries that you want to bundle with your app
#
# flutter_distributor automatically detects the shared libraries that your app
# depends on, but you can also specify them manually here.
#
# The following example shows how to bundle the libcurl library with your app.
#
# include:
#   - libcurl.so.4
include: []

# You can also specify [metainfo](https://freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Quickstart.html) file
# which contains metadata of the app.
